# PyCAT-1.0
Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) activity analysis tool.

The codes described in this README are written in Python 3.7. The Python build is installed using the Anaconda module, and is run on a Windows machine through the Spyder client. The latest anaconda build can be automatically downloded from the following link on to the computer --> https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual. After installing Anaconda on to the computer, the "Anaconda Prompt" and run the following set of commands to fresh install Python 3.7 in a new environment - 
a. conda create --name python37 python=3.7
b. conda install --name python37 spyder -c conda-forge
These commands will create an environment by the name "python37" and set it up for use. After this, the "anaconda navigator" can be started and under the "Applications on" dropdown menu the newly created environment can be found. Clicking on it will switch from the default environment to "python37" environment in which Spyder can be run.
